This repository builds an [interactive report](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/) documenting planning, fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings within the Elk River watershed group in the summer/fall of 2020. Although some planning for future assessments was conducted for both the Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam near Elko, BC and the Flathead River, on the ground surveys focused on the Elk River and tributaries located upstream of the Elko Dam.

 * The report is generated with primarily `R` and `SQL` scripts from a `Rmarkdown` document processing raw data from:
 
    + [Checklist for Habitat Confirmation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/fish-passage/fish-passage-technical/habitat-confirmation-projects) procedures developed by the provincial [Fish Passage Technical Working Group](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/fish-passage/fish-passage-technical) to guide biologists confirming fish habitat value at a stream crossing which has been identified as a potential high‚Äêpriority restoration site.

 + [Custom Excel Spreadsheet](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/raw/master/data/habitat_confirmations_priorities.xlsx) detailing Phase 2 site:
     - priority level for proceeding to design for replacement
     - length of survey upstream and downstream
     - a conservative estimate of mainstem habitat potentially available upstream of the crossing 
     - fish species confirmed as present upstream of the crossing
